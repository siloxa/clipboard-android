 * A utility class for debouncing operations in Android applications.

 * ensuring that it only happens after a specified delay without any additional triggers.
 *
 * This class allows you to debounce a Runnable, preventing it from running until a certain amount
 * of time has passed without further triggers. It's particularly useful in scenarios where you want
 * to delay or prevent rapid, repetitive actions such as button clicks or user input.
